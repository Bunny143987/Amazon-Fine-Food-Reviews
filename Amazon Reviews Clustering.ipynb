      "These traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps.  I have one of these, a harpoon trap, and some that you bury in the tunnels.<br /><br />Poisons, grub killers, and gasses probably don't work, and you will never have a body to know for sure.  Trapping is the best method.<br /><br />I've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole.  Flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did.<br /><br />I've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too, but the scissor type is more effective and I rarely have a sprung trap with no mole.<br /><br />The out o sight scissor trap is the best one.<br /><br />People who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly, I had the same problems until I learned to set them right.<br /><br />Do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them.<br /><br />1. Keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels.<br /><br />2. Pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel, stomp all of the other tunnels down flat, not the one your trapping on.<br /><br />3. If you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours, the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated.  Stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel.<br /><br />I usually catch them overnight\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

They do quite often reject other treats, and certainly after a while of the same other treats.  But then tend to always enjoy these. In fact, I have to be careful not to over feed them these because I don't know if they are healthy to eat in quantity.  Certainly not for my wallet.  They do last a LONG time though, especially compare to their weight.  However, dogs wolf them down quite quickly.  I highly recommend you reward you doggies with some!\n",

      "Freeze dried liver has a hypnotic effect on dogs. They LOVE it and will do just about anything for it, so it is a great treat to use for training. (Powdered freeze dried liver is even added to many dog medicines nowadays-- heartworm and arthritis tablets, etc.-- because it causes the dog to scarf the medicine down like a treat.)<br /><br />Freeze dried liver has a dry, hard, yet powdery/easy to chew consistency. It comes chopped/cubed. It is extremely lightweight due to the fact there is so little moisture in the product (thus the low weights on product labels).<br /><br />Even though your dog will love liver treats, you shouldn't overfeed it. The manufacturer recommends 1-2 cubes daily for small dogs, 2-3 cubes for medium dogs, and 3-4 cubes for large dogs.<br /><br />The largest package sizes of liver treats tend to be far more economical. I recommend buying the larger tubs, as you will save lots of money, you'll have a handy treat supply around for a longer time, and your dog will never tire of this product.<br /><br />There is really zero waste with this product. When you near the end of the tub you'll find some powdery bits of dried liver at the bottom. Your dogs will go CRAZY if you sprinkle this dust over their dog food-- it's a wonderful reward that is easy to use.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br />Here's the nutritional analysis:<br /><br />-100% freeze dried liver<br />-NO additives or preservatives.<br /><br />-Crude protein..... not less than 50%<br />-Crude fat..... not less than 5%<br />-Crude fiber..... not more than 3%<br />-Moisture..... not more than 6%\n",

      "Long live Camper Van Beethoven!! This is a blessing for long time CVB fans who didn't have a chance to upgrade their collection to CD before most of this went out of print.  Wow, where to begin?  CVB was a band that matured on record, so to speak, so this is really a fascinating and entertaining listen from beginning to end.<br />  Of course you get the endearing and humorous debut album with goofy anthems ala \"Take the Skinheads Bowling\" and various folk/ska instrumentals; the increasingly warped and psychedelic \"II & III\"; and this collections' centerpiece: the self titled 3rd album!!  Forget the editorial remark above about them \"scratching their heads out loud\" on this because there's nothing confused, unfocused, or tentative about this album.  I'd say it's a characteristically irreverent and eclectic psych-rock masterpiece.  The song writing has fully matured with the sarcastic humor still intact, and it seems to be intentionally conceived as an album that gets stranger and stranger as it goes on, with the group mastering every diverse style they apply themselves to.  I could go on and on about this album, but suffice it to say it's a classic.<br />  \"Camper Vantiquities\", the 4th CD is a top notch odds and ends collection containing perhaps the best Camper song ever: \"Seven Languages\" and the Harrison/Starkey composition \"Photograph.\"  Finally, the live CD is a competent but not revelatory live set from 1990 with 2 songs from 1988.  I would've prefered to hear an earlier and more chaotic live recording, but I'm sure the quality wouldn't have been as good.<br />  All in all, you can't go wrong with this.  The packaging is quality: a thick , bright orange box with the 5 Cds in simple glossy slip cases, (well, the box is relatively thin but it's made of nice thick cardboard) and a full color booklet with 2 essays.  One is an entertaining first-hand account of what Santa Cruz was like when Camper formed; the other is a dry and factual journalists view on the Camper \"phenomenon\" MUCH LIKE THIS REVIEW.  I hope it was helpful.  Rock on Comrades!!!\n",

Forget the editorial remark above about them \"scratching their heads out loud\" on this because there's nothing confused, unfocused, or tentative about this album.  I'd say it's a characteristically irreverent and eclectic psych-rock masterpiece.  The song writing has fully matured with the sarcastic humor still intact, and it seems to be intentionally conceived as an album that gets stranger and stranger as it goes on, with the group mastering every diverse style they apply themselves to.  I could go on and on about this album, but suffice it to say it's a classic.<br />  \"Camper Vantiquities\", the 4th CD is a top notch odds and ends collection containing perhaps the best Camper song ever: \"Seven Languages\" and the Harrison/Starkey composition \"Photograph.\"  Finally, the live CD is a competent but not revelatory live set from 1990 with 2 songs from 1988.  I would've prefered to hear an earlier and more chaotic live recording, but I'm sure the quality wouldn't have been as good.<br />  All in all, you can't go wrong with this.  The packaging is quality: a thick , bright orange box with the 5 Cds in simple glossy slip cases, (well, the box is relatively thin but it's made of nice thick cardboard) and a full color booklet with 2 essays.  One is an entertaining first-hand account of what Santa Cruz was like when Camper formed; the other is a dry and factual journalists view on the Camper \"phenomenon\" MUCH LIKE THIS REVIEW.  I hope it was helpful.  Rock on Comrades!!!\n",

      "I had fed my dogs Canidae for about 2 months before I had problems but as soon as they switched their formula I went from happy to completely unsatisfied. Both of my dogs broke out in hot spots and they itched all the time. Like other reviews say they had chronic digestive upset and wouldn't touch the food. As soon as we switched foods all went back to normal. I also emailed the company. They emailed me back saying there was no way it was their food because their food is of the highest quality out there. It had to be my dogs. Make sure you buy a food that does feeding trials. I know some may think this is cruel, but do you really want food trials done on your pets? That's what Canidae is doing.\n",

      "I understand all the complaints about Science Diet. Believe me I avoided this food for quite awhile based on that information. I'm not thrilled about the filler, would prefer a food with no by-products, and yes in general think it is over priced. But my cat was throwing up everything else. And I do mean EVERYTHING else. I have tried so many top of the line foods for him and every single one he threw up. I took him to the vet, had all the xrays done, all the blood work done, put him on antibotics just in case... nothing. He is a perfectly healthy cat except that he was throwing up food 2 to 3 times a week. I talked to my mom who had 2 Siamese cats that lived into thier late teens and she said she fed them Science Diet. In fact, one of them had urninary tract problems and the SD was the only food that stopped his problems. So yes, I understand everything everyone is saying about why SD is so horrible... yet I can't argue with the results. I fed my cat this and it's been 3 weeks with no vomiting. My mom fed it to her cats and they lived long, healthy lives. I just can't argue with the results. And even if there were risks it's worth it not to have my poor kitty completely emptying his stomach 2-3 times a week from food that is making him sick. If your cat keeps throwing up, you've had the vet check him and there is nothing wrong and no other food is working... try this food. It really did work for my cat.\n",

      "Tim Burton had come off the blockbuster success of his first feature film PEE-WEE'S BIG ADVENTURE (1985) when he was greenlighted by Warner Bros. to direct the project he REALLY wanted to make. It was the picture that would define the rest of his career to this day: the supernaturally weird black comedy (and weirdly-titled) BEETLEJUICE (1988). It was so unique, so strange to me that I didn't know what to make of it when I first saw it on video in 1989. I remember from that first time liking parts of it, but not liking the picture as a whole. The movie was so frenetic, so odd in its mixture of Goth Horror, Comedy, gruesome visual effects (I'm still kind of amazed that it got a PG rating instead of PG-13) and cartoonish slapstick that I really didn't know what to make if it. Well, now that I've seen it at least a half-dozen times since (three of them in the past year alone), I can say that it has held up better than many of the most popular 80's films (TOP GUN, etc) and has become a classic all unto itself.<p>With BEETLEJUICE, Tim Burton showed not only that he could direct effective comedy and illicit inspired performances from his actors, but also bring a true artist's touch to the big screen. Of course, the film won the Oscar for Best Makeup (as if there was any real question about it), but I also think that it should have also been at least nominated for Visual Effects and Art Direction, as those truly mesmerizing aspects all come together to create a product that is so unique. Not only that, but this film helped make the careers of several actors who would go on to major success soon after.<p>Two of those actors are Alec Baldwin and Geena Davis, as the ill-fated newlyweds Adam and Barbara Maitland who, after buying a big Victorian dream house at the film's outset, die in a bizarre car accident soon after. Slowly realizing that they've passed on to the next world, they don't want to give up their house to the pathetically bourgeois Charles &amp; Delia Deetz (Jeffrey Jones &amp; Catherine O'Hara), who along with their chubby, effete chauffeur Otho (Glenn Shadix) have already moved in, and inspire true disgust in the newly-dead couple. However, they seem to have an ally in the older couple's death-obsessed Goth daughter Lydia (Winona Ryder) see an afterlife advertisement for a &quot;Bio-Exorcist&quot; named Betelgeuse (Michael Keaton) and decide that their only hope in driving out the destestable Charles, Delia, and Otho is in using the wild, unpredictable Betelgeuse. Of course, good ol' Betelgeuse will gladly provide his unique brand of service, but at a very high price. <p>Alec Baldwin &amp; Geena Davis fill their roles very well. The ironic thing is that this was the first film I'd ever seen Alec Baldwin in, so my first impression of him as the nerdy, good-natured Adam ended up being turned around by 180 degrees by the psychotic, tough-guy roles that would define the rest of his career. That turnabout came pretty quickly, actually, as the very next film I would see him in was MARRIED TO THE MOB (1988), in which he was a mobster unbeknownst to his wife who gets offed early on, but it was his psychotic turn in the extremely quirky and violent MIAMI BLUES (1989) that really shocked me and made me realize that Alec really had some range to him (unfortunately, he would be end up being typecast as psychos for the rest of his career). However, Geena Davis, herself at the cusp of stardom (and Oscar acclaim) is playing pretty much the quirky kind of character that would eventually define her career. In fact, it was just the following year that she would win the Oscar for Best Supporting Actress for playing the truly quirky and inspired Muriel Pritchett in the otherwise uninspired THE ACCIDENTAL TOURIST (1989). This film, of course, also boosted the career of the now-infamous Winona Ryder, who quickly became the hot new &quot;it&quot; girl in the late 80's with this movie and with others soon to follow: 1969 (1988), HEATHERS (1989), GREAT BALLS OF FIRE! (also 1989), EDWARD SCISSORHANDS (1990, and another Tim Burton film) and MERMAIDS (also 1990). Of course, former AMADEUS (1984) emperor and FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986) principal Jeffrey Jones, now infamous for his own reasons, is also terrific here, as is former &quot;SC-TV&quot; alumnus Catherine O'Hara. We also get a welcome supporting performance from the great old character actress, Sylvia Sidney, as the chain-smoking receptionist Juno!<p>But it was Michael Keaton, who was already an up-and-coming comedic actor known for quirky hit comedies such as the Ron Howard-directed NIGHT SHIFT (1982), MR. MOM (1983), JOHNNY DANGEROUSLY (1984) and GUNG HO (1986), who really stole the show and hit paydirt in the process. He would immediately be elevated to &quot;A&quot; list status with his truly brilliant, maniacal and hilarious performance as the titular Betelgeuse, going immediately on to bigger &amp; better things with Tim Burton himself, starring soon after as BATMAN (1989)! It's funny; I think that in 1988, Keaton was robbed of Oscar nominations not only for this truly unique comedic role, but for also his surprising dramatic turn as a recovering alcoholic in CLEAN AND SOBER. It just shows that, for whatever reason, comedians just don't get recognized enough for their acting ability.<p>BEETLEJUICE is a lot of fun. It looks like it must have been a lot of fun to make. Despite the liberal PG rating, I would recommend it only for ages 9 &amp; up, as the humor is quite adult and the rather gruesome visuals are likely to give any young child nightmares. It is still a truly unique movie with incredible special effects, and it still makes me laugh to this day. Oddly enough, whenever I see it, it makes me that much less afraid to die!<p>HIGHLY RECOMMENDED\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

My brother had a Victor Trap he would lend to me when he wasn't using it. I got 4 in 2 weeks. I've looked everywhere for these traps but couldn't find them in stores.

None of those worked very well but I got my first mole 3 days after installing one of these in my backyard.

      "This product isn't that impressive as far as taste goes. Yes, it'll do what you need it to do for drop flowers, shells, rosettes, etc. But you could just as easily buy meringue powder (dried egg whites) at the supermarket and add it to a regular can of store icing or even homemade buttercream for a much better taste. If taking a Wilton coure, they try to sell you their entire catalog of products, which would explain why this is recommended for the class. It tastes like Crisco-y vanilla. I'd be embarrassed to use this on a cake or cupcakes that I am serving to people. It's really not a pleasant taste.<br /><br />If you do want to buy this for a Wilton course or another reason, buy it at Michaels, AC Moore, or a local baking supply store. I love Amazon--really, I do. But this is listed at nearly $9.00 here. At Michaels it's less than $4.00 (use a coupon and it's a little more than half that). At a local baking supply store, it was $3.29 plus tax. I have no clue why this is so ridiculously overpriced here, and I'm annoyed I actually could have bought two or three at Michaels for the price of ONE here.\n",

The child gets to go through the months of the year and go to wonderful places like Bombay and down the Nile, all the while, eating, well, you know what they get to eat.  Some kids will have Maurice Sendak's version of ice skating or how to treat roses in their heads for a long time and they won't even know where it came from.  Surprise!

      "Swheat Scoop absorbs liquid better than the original rock-type litter, keeps the litterbox smelling fresher than crystals and is much safer for the cats, my son and the environment than the latest super clumping, micro-fine, choke-on-the-dust stuff on the market.<br /><br />Yes, the litterbox still has the potential to stink but hey, look at what's going in that box! I have 3 adopted kittens that I am actively trying to plump up, so you can imagine what both of our litterboxes are like. However, I have noticed that by cleaning the boxes morning and night, the \"stinky\" is almost non-existent. I don't have to deal with the distinctive litterbox perfume overkill either (you know, the \"pretty\" smell).<br /><br />To ensure better clumping, take a note from those automatic cat boxes and do not scoop immediately after kitty goes potty. You do want to clean the box at least once a day, twice if you can manage it, because wet wheat litter will stick to the bottom of the box and/or bag just like the superfine clay type does. Not fun.<br /><br />As this is a natural wheat product, you do want to care for it a little more than traditional litter. Check the product as soon as you get home and then periodically re-check it just to make sure you don't have any uninvited and unwelcome little guests. You may also want to invest in some pantry pest traps, just in case, and place them wherever you plan to store the Swheat Scoop.<br /><br />There really isn't a \"perfect\" cat litter but I have to admit I was really tempted to give a five star rating. Two of my kittens are disabled and cannot control their hind legs very well. This means frequent accidents and sometimes a bit of shmutz. It is really nice to know that they aren't going to have super clumping clay clogging their little insides if they clean up before I get to them.<br /><br />Overall, I give Swheat Scoop a two thumbs up and a four star rating instead of five simply because of that slight bit of extra maintenance required.\n",

      "These liver treas are phenomenal. When i received the 14oz. bucket by amazon i began training my 3month old Alaskan malamute. Now that a month has passed by, she now knows: Sit, Stay, Down, Paw, & SPEAK! My bucket is almost empty as it only lasted for about a month but was worth every penny as ive read malamutes are very stubborn quite dogs. I gave some to my 2 poodles where they gobbled it down and were begging for more. These treats are highly recommended, plus the liver cubes can be further broken down into quadrants. A+++ product\n",

      "These traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps.  I have one of these, a harpoon trap, and some that you bury in the tunnels.<br /><br />Poisons, grub killers, and gasses probably don't work, and you will never have a body to know for sure.  Trapping is the best method.<br /><br />I've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole.  Flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did.<br /><br />I've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too, but the scissor type is more effective and I rarely have a sprung trap with no mole.<br /><br />The out o sight scissor trap is the best one.<br /><br />People who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly, I had the same problems until I learned to set them right.<br /><br />Do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them.<br /><br />1. Keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels.<br /><br />2. Pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel, stomp all of the other tunnels down flat, not the one your trapping on.<br /><br />3. If you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours, the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated.  Stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel.<br /><br />I usually catch them overnight\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

      "I had a tunnel along my concrete driveway and the grass about 10' long and had 5 mole hills.  I set a trap at both ends.  When I dug into the first mole hill to set the trap I noticed a half eaten grub and placed it on the trigger bar, covered with some dirt, and put a pail over the trap to keep it dark.<br />About 2 hours later I checked the trap and it had sprung. I carefully lifted the trap and a mole was caught in the trap but not dead.  Be ready for that.<br />I have not seen any further evidence of moles but if I use this trap again I will try adding a grub or worm bait to attract them.\n",

      "I have a large yard with several moles.  I called a mole/pest removal company.  I hired them and paid 200.00 to have about a dozen traps set (yes, they used these exact traps which is why I ordered some for myself).<br /><br />Anyway, they had 30 days to trap moles in my yard.  They also charged 69.00 for each mole they caught.  They got 5 moles in that time.<br /><br />That may not seem like many, but if you read about moles, you'll find out they are not like mice or rats.  They breed slowly and live alone.  They reproduce once per year and maybe have 2-4 offspring of which maybe half will live in natural conditions.  When you see an area or network of mole tunnels (your grass pushed up), that's just one mole... If you study the tunnels, you'll usually see it comes in from the edge of your yard where there may be more moisture (forest or wild area).<br /><br />You just need to look at the branching of the tunnels and find a few areas where you can guess the mole may be re-using that section to go back and forth.<br /><br />Once you locate a good spot, gently push the grass down to collapse the tunnel, and set the trap.  Be sure to set the trap so the spikes that go in the ground (not the spikes that kill the mole) are not right in the middle of the mole tunnel.  The idea (obviously) is to set the trap in an area the mole will try to use again.  When the mole tries to fix the tunnel, bam!<br /><br />I just trapped my first mole today.  I saw the spring of the trap was down, took the trap up, and the mole was dead underneath.<br /><br />This trap does work to kill the mole.  YOu just need to put it in the right place and set it correctly.<br /><br />The guy who worked for the pest control company told me most of this and it really makes a difference.<br /><br />I'm here to buy a few more traps.  I would suggest getting two traps for each distinct area you think there may be a mole.  I plan to just keep rotating 4-6 traps until all the moles are gone.\n",

      "My cats do like the food, although when I first started to feed them they kind of picked at it. Now I feed them only this food and a little bit of the dry food from this company and its no problem. My one cat was over weight and he is now more active and running around with the other cats and he looks much healthier and younger. I have one cat that vomits a lot and have had to buy special vet food, which helped him stop vomiting and he can eat this food too with no problem. I will say that the cats do like the chicken and herring recipe better, I think they like fish in general more then poultry. I do highly recommend this food, its worth the price, considering the vet food is just as expensive and there are lots of pork by-products and low quality grains in the ingredient list.\n",

      "Unlike the previous reviewer, my cats like the Au Jus cans.  They enjoy the chicken, turkey, rabbit and duck flavors.  I like to feed my cats a high-protein diet to keep them trim, and this food helps me reach that goal.<br /><br />The only reason I'm giving the food 4 stars instead of 5 is because you can't feed it alone.  It doesn't have the vitamins cats need as a standalone food.  It's good for a meal a few times a week or top-dressed with supplements.  I also wish the Au Jus varieties came in the smaller cans.  It's hard for 2 cats to go through a huge can in a couple of days.<br /><br />If you're feeding your cats grocery store foods, they probably won't like this.  If they're used to eating premium foods and occasional raw meat like mine are, they should take to this food with no problem.\n",

      "I have 5 dogs and plenty of fruit trees on my premises that attract plenty of flies during the summer. In desperate need to get rid of some of the flies, I purchased 3 different fly traps. This one is the WINNER! It took 3 days for this product to attract flies, but once it did it worked well. I have had this trap outside for 5 days and it is half way filled with those annoying flies. My yard is not fly free ,but I'm happy to see that I can get rid of some flies by simply hanging the trap on a tree.\n",

      "I live in an urban neighborhood and I hate flies so I'm starting to buy these things by the crate.  Everyone should use them, they work.<br /><br />Pros - I've killed literally thousands of flies.  Gallons of flies. Eventually I think I'll manage to wipe out the local breeding population and get ahead of the curve.  Trick is to start early in the spring - what one is really trying to achieve is population control not just killing a few flies.  Otherwise (depending on your landscape of course) the neighbors flies will just move in.  Bottom line if you use it according to the directions this flytrap works extremely well.  Many of the negative reviews here clearly didn't read the directions.  It really needs to be in sunlight.<br /><br />Cons - it reeks.  Seriously.  I can't imagine anyone using this inside their house - when it gets going you don't really want to be within 20 feet of it.  Unbelievably strong smell of rotting garbage. And though it's theoretically reusable, you are unlikely to do so unless you have a really strong stomach.  Think a big jar of rotting dead and half dead flies.  It's really foul.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you use it properly - think some form of perimeter defense, with targeting of fly hot spots like garbage cans with loose lids, you can make your world fly free.  If you have really few flies, one jar properly located will take care of them, but you should actually spend some time analyzing what you need.<br /><br />Anecdotally and by observation, btw, this seems like the most effective fly trap on the market\n",

      "These pops were absolutely awful. My first try was the German Chocolate Cake, which barely tasted like chocolate and more like a mild root beer flavored candy. The second try was the Cherry Cheesecake, which tasted like cherry flavored cough syrup. The third attempt was the Coconut Creme Pie, which had a mild coconut flavor.<br /><br />I gave up after the third attempt and shared a few of the remaining pops with some coworkers; most of them hated the pops as well, stating they tasted very artificial.<br /><br />I was very disappointed considering other products of this nature appear to have higher ratings.\n",

      "****<br />Tazo's Zen Green Tea with Lemongrass & Spearmint has a subtle, mild, light green tea taste, not bitter at all. I don't taste any of the additional flavors Tazo puts into this tea; maybe my palate isn't developed to this point. However, it still is one of their better teas, and has less of an artificial taste than the others I've tried. Maybe the flavorings are just too mild in this tea, but when it comes to flavorings, I prefer them this way; I like a natural, real taste with real ingredients sans vague \"natural flavors\" and sans flavorings, sans essences, etc. It is not a strong green tea, so it would definitely appeal to people who enjoy herbal infusions and milder teas.<br /><br />The ingredients in Zen are: green teas, lemon verbena, spearmint, lemongrass, and natural flavors. Zen contains caffeine.<br /><br />Tazo is an interesting company that makes only super premium teas. They are socially responsible, based in Portland, and have the motto, \"The Reincarnation of Tea\". Tazo is owned by Starbucks. Their web site is fun and quirky, with a Zen-type focus, definitely worth checking out. It is unclear, though, from their web site, how many of their ingredients are organic or kosher, and they do use some \"natural flavors\" in their teas--this wording seems a little vague for a super premium tea.<br /><br />On the paper tea packet, Tazo writes, \"an enlightening blend of the finest green teas and rare herbs available in this world.\" On their web site, Tazo describes the flavor profile of Zen as \"smooth, lemony, earthy, refreshing\". Tazo describes the aroma as \"lemon, mint\". The web site also says, \"Select pan-fired green tea from Zhejiang province in China, artfully combined with lemongrass, spearmint and a hint of lemon essence. Zen's distinct green tea flavor accented with lemon and mint is impossible to express in words. Best simply to experience its sweet, lingering aftertaste.\" I don't taste the lemon or the mint or the sweetness; still, it is a nice green tea. It is relaxing and enjoyable to drink.<br /><br />I would rate this tea, and Tazo in general, as very good---better than premium teas like Stash or Celestial Seasonings.<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "I've never had to deal with moles before but this trap works great. I agree with other posters that trapping them is the best option; in the end you have a dead mole to prove that you got it unlike poisons which just leave you wondering if you got it or not. I set up the trap like the guy on the most helpful review said. Didn't even try it the way the box said because those directions are not clear at all. We pushed the ground down with our feet over the trap area. It did trip about a minute after we set it which was a false alarm so we reset it. A few days later we saw that the ground around the trap had been pushed up, so the mole went over it but it didn't trip the trap. I was going to push it down further but I never got around to it. About a week after that I saw that it had tripped and though it was another false alarm but when I pulled it out there was a mole in its jaws.  I would say that you might have to tinker with it a few times to get the sensitivity right but if the mole travels through the tunnel regularly it will get it. The jaws are extreamly powerful and it's pretty hard for them to miss unlike the traps that have a single spike.  Overall I'm very happy with it. When I first saw we had a mole I figured it would be almost impossible to get it, but bought this trap due to the good reviews. I'm pleasantly surprised with this trap and will use it again if any more mole tunnels appear.\n",

Yes, it'll do what you need it to do for drop flowers, shells, rosettes, etc. But you could just as easily buy meringue powder (dried egg whites) at the supermarket and add it to a regular can of store icing or even homemade buttercream for a much better taste. If taking a Wilton coure, they try to sell you their entire catalog of products, which would explain why this is recommended for the class. It tastes like Crisco-y vanilla. I'd be embarrassed to use this on a cake or cupcakes that I am serving to people. It's really not a pleasant taste.<br /><br />If you do want to buy this for a Wilton course or another reason, buy it at Michaels, AC Moore, or a local baking supply store. I love Amazon--really, I do. But this is listed at nearly $9.00 here. At Michaels it's less than $4.00 (use a coupon and it's a little more than half that). At a local baking supply store, it was $3.29 plus tax. I have no clue why this is so ridiculously overpriced here, and I'm annoyed I actually could have bought two or three at Michaels for the price of ONE here.\n",

      "I have been feeding my greyhounds these treats for years.  My hounds can be a little finicky, but they love these treats.  They are expensive, relative to other biscuits, but I find they are a good addition to their diet.  The treats are easy on the teeth.  Since they are protein treat, be careful not to overindulge your pet on a regular basis.  They are great treats to take on walks as you can stuff them in your pocket easily.  I have found prices can vary from vendor to vendor, so shop around.\n",

Well suited to 1.5 y/o old to 4+.<br /><br />Very few children's books are worth owning. Most should be borrowed from the library. This book, however, deserves a permanent spot on your shelf. Sendak's best.\n",

      "What can I say? This is a CLASSIC! I've seen this movie so many times I actually have most of the words memorized. This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it. It's an all around great movie.<p>Michael Keaton does an excellent job of playing the odd, funny, and perverted Beetlejuice who causes quite the chaos with a newly deceased couple, Adam and Barbara. Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<p>The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<p>If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT. And for all the Beetlejuice lovers and fans out there this is a must have to your video or DVD collection~\n",

This allows us to give him multiple treats for going potty outside (like 3-5 mini treats each time).  We also use these whenever our puppy meets a stranger -- we make sure all four paws are on the ground before we give it to him and he has already learned to inhibit his desire to jump up on people!  These are amazing and I appreciate that they are made in the USA -- no weird chemicals to worry about -- and our pup loves to work for them!\n",

I reviewed the Amazon site for what I thought was a good price when the Ad showed 2 bottles of the product.  I thought I was getting two bottles for the price.  I only received One bottle.  I wrote the company customer Services who agreed that the two bottles was misleading and they would get back to me the next day after she talked to her supervisor.  That was on December 13 and today is December 23 and still no response, even after 3 other emails from me.  This company is very, very poor in customer service as well and misleading in their ads.  I believe that Amazon is partially at blame for this problem and that this company should no longer be able to sell their products from Amazon Market.  Avoid PetFoodDirect.com because you will get taken.\n",

      "These liver treas are phenomenal. When i received the 14oz. bucket by amazon i began training my 3month old Alaskan malamute. Now that a month has passed by, she now knows: Sit, Stay, Down, Paw, & SPEAK! My bucket is almost empty as it only lasted for about a month but was worth every penny as ive read malamutes are very stubborn quite dogs. I gave some to my 2 poodles where they gobbled it down and were begging for more. These treats are highly recommended, plus the liver cubes can be further broken down into quadrants. A+++ product\n",

      "Our yard was COMPLETELY overrun with moles this year.  The lawn was dead and the trails were everywhere we walked--literally.  We tried sulphur bombs (the Giant Destroyer), spring traps, castor oil (lots of it), Talpirid (80 worms), sonic molechasers (13 of them on 3/4 acre--way more than was suggested), and finally a professional mole guy which cost us $450 to place poison bait (all we got from that is a sick cat and a $150 vet bill), but no dead moles.  Killing grubs doesn't work because their main love is earthworms and you definitely don't want to kill those.  Everything that you read says that trapping is the only way to truly rid yourself of moles.  They only reproduce once a year and usually have litters of 3 to 4 pups--and half of them die.  The only reason we get overrun by them is from not trapping them and using deterrents that only work for short periods of time, allowing their numbers to increase (from what I've read). I read about this product and all the great reviews and I chose to *believe* one last time, so I ordered 6 of them. We went outside this afternoon to set 2 of the traps and within 1 hour we had our first mole!!!  He was huge and very well fed, he lived a good life. RIP.<br /><br />Initially, we did get completely frustrated and we each threw one across the yard, then we calmed down and figured it out. The reviewers all had great tips and I re-read them.  The thing to remember is to set the trap and put the safety on BEFORE you try and put it in the ground (sounds obvious, but it seemed easier to place it in the ground first and it wasn't). The spring is VERY strong, but the metal bars they put in the package make it easy enough to open the trap with both hands, then hold it open with one hand, and keeping the plate near the ground for leverage, engage the pin on the striking plate and flip the locking pin over.  The only other hard part is finding the right type of tunnel!<br /><br />I'm convinced there is no \"natural* way to get rid of moles--I wish there was--but the only thing that is ultimately going to work is trapping them.  Be patient and don't give up, it really is easy to set this trap once you get the hang of it.  GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2009:  Just caught another one this morning!  The trails are dwindling...<br /><br />UPDATE 5/2010:  Our grass finally grew back in after the moles killed every square inch of the lawn last year. We ended up getting about 5 moles. Just got the traps out again for the summer season as we noticed a small area being dug up.  We found a straight trail, set the trap and caught him within 4 hours!\n",

      "I bought a few of these after my apartment was infested with fruit flies. After only a few hours, the trap had &quot;attracted&quot; many flies and within a few days they were practically gone. This may not be a long term  solution, but if flies are driving you crazy, consider buying this. One  caution- the surface is very sticky, so try to avoid touching it.\n",

      "A very well built mole trap that works great when set correctly.  The safety latch is a nice feature that prevents accidental tripping while setting the trap. I don't follow the box instructions but rather set the traps on the surface.  This works well with a lot less effort than trying to bury them.  I've found that a person needs to be very patient.  The mole may not use the tunnel for several days.  In fact I've caught some after five or six days.  Picking the best tunnel is the hardest part of trapping moles so spent your time there rather than moving traps around every two days.\n",

      "I have a large yard with several moles.  I called a mole/pest removal company.  I hired them and paid 200.00 to have about a dozen traps set (yes, they used these exact traps which is why I ordered some for myself).<br /><br />Anyway, they had 30 days to trap moles in my yard.  They also charged 69.00 for each mole they caught.  They got 5 moles in that time.<br /><br />That may not seem like many, but if you read about moles, you'll find out they are not like mice or rats.  They breed slowly and live alone.  They reproduce once per year and maybe have 2-4 offspring of which maybe half will live in natural conditions.  When you see an area or network of mole tunnels (your grass pushed up), that's just one mole... If you study the tunnels, you'll usually see it comes in from the edge of your yard where there may be more moisture (forest or wild area).<br /><br />You just need to look at the branching of the tunnels and find a few areas where you can guess the mole may be re-using that section to go back and forth.<br /><br />Once you locate a good spot, gently push the grass down to collapse the tunnel, and set the trap.  Be sure to set the trap so the spikes that go in the ground (not the spikes that kill the mole) are not right in the middle of the mole tunnel.  The idea (obviously) is to set the trap in an area the mole will try to use again.  When the mole tries to fix the tunnel, bam!<br /><br />I just trapped my first mole today.  I saw the spring of the trap was down, took the trap up, and the mole was dead underneath.<br /><br />This trap does work to kill the mole.  YOu just need to put it in the right place and set it correctly.<br /><br />The guy who worked for the pest control company told me most of this and it really makes a difference.<br /><br />I'm here to buy a few more traps.  I would suggest getting two traps for each distinct area you think there may be a mole.  I plan to just keep rotating 4-6 traps until all the moles are gone.\n",

      "A great collection of music from CVB> A great way to get into CVB if you've recently become a fan.<br />I Have had an interest in CVB since I heard the track Pictures of matchstick men on the local community radio station probably in the late 90's.It was a good track,with many of the elements I look for in music. I like the variety of instruments the band employs(violin,banjo,steel guitar & sitar etc) are some of the instruments used in the cigarettes & carrot juice collection.<br />Even though I only heard my second CVB track when I bought this collection in late 2010, It does'nt really matter as unique, lively & colorful music such as this loses nothing over time.Don't know if they have ever toured Australia,but it would definitely be on my list.\n",

      "I've always loved chicken soup and rice. My late great-grandmother, Ethel, always made me homemade chicken, chicken soup and rice. This book takes me back to the days my mother, my father, my sister, and I went to Ethel's house. My late great-grandfather, Isadore, would cook the chicken because Ethel was blind. So, it reminds me of the time we were all together as a family. It brings back happy memories of all the love we shared over bowls of hot soup.\n",

      "This is a book of poetry about the months of the year.  It goes through each month and has a cute little poem to go along with it.  I love this book because it is a really fun way to learn the months and the poems are very creative. The author's purpose for writing this book was to give children a fun way to learn the months.  The children can also learn things about poetry and rhythm through reading this book.\n",

      "This is a great little book to read aloud- it has a nice rhythm as well as good repetition that little ones like, in the lines about \"chicken soup with rice\".  The child gets to go through the months of the year and go to wonderful places like Bombay and down the Nile, all the while, eating, well, you know what they get to eat.  Some kids will have Maurice Sendak's version of ice skating or how to treat roses in their heads for a long time and they won't even know where it came from.  Surprise!  It came from this little witty book.  :-)\n",

      "These traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps.  I have one of these, a harpoon trap, and some that you bury in the tunnels.<br /><br />Poisons, grub killers, and gasses probably don't work, and you will never have a body to know for sure.  Trapping is the best method.<br /><br />I've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole.  Flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did.<br /><br />I've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too, but the scissor type is more effective and I rarely have a sprung trap with no mole.<br /><br />The out o sight scissor trap is the best one.<br /><br />People who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly, I had the same problems until I learned to set them right.<br /><br />Do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them.<br /><br />1. Keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels.<br /><br />2. Pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel, stomp all of the other tunnels down flat, not the one your trapping on.<br /><br />3. If you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours, the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated.  Stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel.<br /><br />I usually catch them overnight\n",

I also love their \"eyes so bright\" product which has saved my cocker spaniel from eye problems.  Use a cotton ball for easier application.<br /><br />I highly recommend this product!\n",

      "What can I say? This is a CLASSIC! I've seen this movie so many times I actually have most of the words memorized. This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it. It's an all around great movie.<p>Michael Keaton does an excellent job of playing the odd, funny, and perverted Beetlejuice who causes quite the chaos with a newly deceased couple, Adam and Barbara. Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<p>The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<p>If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT. And for all the Beetlejuice lovers and fans out there this is a must have to your video or DVD collection~\n",

      "I originally bought the Zuke's Treats for Cats on Amazon.com. It arrived in a decent amount of time (I didn't expect it to be quick since I used the free shipping). My cat thought they were just okay, and would eat them if i put them in front of her, but not come running as she does for her other treats. So I would leave them out for her in her dish, and they would get hard real quick. After maybe eating 5-20 of the little pieces total, she stopped eating them altogether, and walked AWAY when i got out the treats.<br />Then I went to Petco after adopting a puppy, and Petco convinced me they would be perfect for training so i got the ones for dogs. I thought maybe the shipping made them stale, and Petco assured me the ones for dogs were of better quality. Unfortunately this was not the case, my dog who eats shoes, and ANYTHING else that's on the floor does not want to eat these. I mean they are okay but barely okay. When I take her on walks and use them to redirect her attention and they are hard by the time we get home from our walk, and she will spit out over half of them on the sidewalk. So if your pet likes hard food then they might like them (and they are real ingredients,) but if your pet is like mine, they wont touch them. I now have two barely opened packages of this stuff that just sits under my cupboard.\n",

The child gets to go through the months of the year and go to wonderful places like Bombay and down the Nile, all the while, eating, well, you know what they get to eat.  Some kids will have Maurice Sendak's version of ice skating or how to treat roses in their heads for a long time and they won't even know where it came from.  Surprise!

When this arrived, I was quite excited to get my slow cooker going and have a great stew, however when I opened the package, there was at least 8 cups of blood and intestinal type matter with the carcass. I went ahead and cleaned it up and everything worked fine but I cannot recommend this product as it's a pain to clean the body up before cooking, my preference is out of the bag straight to crock pot without having to deal with blood and guts....guess this is what happens with age.\n",

I bought these because they were the least expensive and I thought that they would be comparable to other name brands.  edible pens are edible pens, right?  Wrong! We made 60 baby themed cake pops and we needed these pens to draw the eyes, hair and cheeks on the \"babies.\"  My daughter and her friend were practically cursing these pens before the night was over.  The black marker held up a little better that the rest, but the other colors were not good at all.  They smeared everywhere after a while.  The tips were not the best.  It was almost like they could not handle the interaction with the chocolate.  They got the job done, but barely.  Next time, I would add a little money to my purchase and get the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0020ZURDI\">Americolor Food Marker Writers- 10 Color Pack</a>.  I have heard nothing but good things about these pens, and plus they are the ones that Bakerella uses and recommends on her cake pops. :)\n",

My area is very sandy and I consider the spear/plunger type traps a total rip off, for me anyway. Never caught one til I got this trap.. These moles are very destructive to my plants. I've read all the mumbo jumbo from the go green guys about how moles just eat grubs and help aerate the soil. Yeah right! They have killed fruit trees and plowed down whole rows of my vegetable garden.. By whatever means they manage to kill my plants.. So I hope to kill more with this trap..\n",

      "I bought a few of these after my apartment was infested with fruit flies. After only a few hours, the trap had &quot;attracted&quot; many flies and within a few days they were practically gone. This may not be a long term  solution, but if flies are driving you crazy, consider buying this. One  caution- the surface is very sticky, so try to avoid touching it.\n",

      "I had done quite a bit of research before I chose a dog food for my dogs and this seems to be the best for the money for what I needed. I needed something that would benefit different age stages nutritionally, in bulk, for the best price. This is what I based my research on and came up with this dog food. One of my dogs, full grown and used to eating different brands of junk before I knew what I was feeding him, was not too fond of it at first but got used to it and now he eats it without any issue. My puppy loves it and will overstuff herself if I do not ration for meal times. It gives me peace of mind that they both are getting what they need and I am not going broke giving it to them. My only complaint is the horrid flatulence this dog food seems to give them. I have never experienced that with my adult dog in the 4 years he's been with me but then again he has always eaten the store brands of dog food so maybe that's the issue? Overall, I am satisfied and can live with the occasional unpleasantness for a few seconds if it means they are eating healthy. There is also a NOTICEABLE difference in their coats and health. So that's another plus. I couldn't in good conscience give it five just because the flatulence really is 'room clearing'.......S'pose that could have it's uses for unwanted guests on the bright side.\n",

      "I have been feeding my greyhounds these treats for years.  My hounds can be a little finicky, but they love these treats.  They are expensive, relative to other biscuits, but I find they are a good addition to their diet.  The treats are easy on the teeth.  Since they are protein treat, be careful not to overindulge your pet on a regular basis.  They are great treats to take on walks as you can stuff them in your pocket easily.  I have found prices can vary from vendor to vendor, so shop around.\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it.

Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<p>The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<p>If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT.

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.  I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "Freeze-dried liver treats are easy to carry around in a treat pouch, don't have to be refrigerated and, so far as I know, are healthy, high-protein snacks without a lot of chemical additives and preservatives. All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer.\n",

I'm not gonna dwell on it, but I'm just sayin...\n",

      "These traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps.  I have one of these, a harpoon trap, and some that you bury in the tunnels.<br /><br />Poisons, grub killers, and gasses probably don't work, and you will never have a body to know for sure.  Trapping is the best method.<br /><br />I've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole.  Flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did.<br /><br />I've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too, but the scissor type is more effective and I rarely have a sprung trap with no mole.<br /><br />The out o sight scissor trap is the best one.<br /><br />People who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly, I had the same problems until I learned to set them right.<br /><br />Do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them.<br /><br />1. Keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels.<br /><br />2. Pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel, stomp all of the other tunnels down flat, not the one your trapping on.<br /><br />3. If you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours, the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated.  Stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel.<br /><br />I usually catch them overnight\n",

      "Our yard was COMPLETELY overrun with moles this year.  The lawn was dead and the trails were everywhere we walked--literally.  We tried sulphur bombs (the Giant Destroyer), spring traps, castor oil (lots of it), Talpirid (80 worms), sonic molechasers (13 of them on 3/4 acre--way more than was suggested), and finally a professional mole guy which cost us $450 to place poison bait (all we got from that is a sick cat and a $150 vet bill), but no dead moles.  Killing grubs doesn't work because their main love is earthworms and you definitely don't want to kill those.  Everything that you read says that trapping is the only way to truly rid yourself of moles.  They only reproduce once a year and usually have litters of 3 to 4 pups--and half of them die.  The only reason we get overrun by them is from not trapping them and using deterrents that only work for short periods of time, allowing their numbers to increase (from what I've read). I read about this product and all the great reviews and I chose to *believe* one last time, so I ordered 6 of them. We went outside this afternoon to set 2 of the traps and within 1 hour we had our first mole!!!  He was huge and very well fed, he lived a good life. RIP.<br /><br />Initially, we did get completely frustrated and we each threw one across the yard, then we calmed down and figured it out. The reviewers all had great tips and I re-read them.  The thing to remember is to set the trap and put the safety on BEFORE you try and put it in the ground (sounds obvious, but it seemed easier to place it in the ground first and it wasn't). The spring is VERY strong, but the metal bars they put in the package make it easy enough to open the trap with both hands, then hold it open with one hand, and keeping the plate near the ground for leverage, engage the pin on the striking plate and flip the locking pin over.  The only other hard part is finding the right type of tunnel!<br /><br />I'm convinced there is no \"natural* way to get rid of moles--I wish there was--but the only thing that is ultimately going to work is trapping them.  Be patient and don't give up, it really is easy to set this trap once you get the hang of it.  GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2009:  Just caught another one this morning!  The trails are dwindling...<br /><br />UPDATE 5/2010:  Our grass finally grew back in after the moles killed every square inch of the lawn last year. We ended up getting about 5 moles. Just got the traps out again for the summer season as we noticed a small area being dug up.  We found a straight trail, set the trap and caught him within 4 hours!\n",

This movie is hilariously funny, but at the same time it has a touch of drama in it. It's an all around great movie.<p>Michael Keaton does an excellent job of playing the odd, funny, and perverted Beetlejuice who causes quite the chaos with a newly deceased couple, Adam and Barbara. Let me just say no one and I mean NO ONE could've been better for the part of Beetlejuice.<p>The only disapointting thing about the DVD Beetljuice is there were no deleted scenes or extra footage.. I was disapointed, but I love this movie so much it was still worth it!<p>If you haven't seen Beetlejuice, then YOU MUST SEE IT.

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.  I've read a few articles now about the effects of cicadas on the ecosystem, and one thing that is consistent is that up to 2 years before a cicada emergence, mole activity is increased.  On the other hand, you can expect to see decreased mole activity after they emerge.  So, that might explain why so many in our area have been having mole issues.  Hopefully after the stupid cicadas are gone, some of the moles will go with them.<br /><br />EDIT 5-3-12:  I would love to talk to the 3 people who didn't find this review helpful.

      "These traps have a much better kill ratio than the other traps.  I have one of these, a harpoon trap, and some that you bury in the tunnels.<br /><br />Poisons, grub killers, and gasses probably don't work, and you will never have a body to know for sure.  Trapping is the best method.<br /><br />I've also flooded the tunnels then shot the mole.  Flooding the tunnels did more damage than the mole did.<br /><br />I've also nailed a couple with a harpoon trap too, but the scissor type is more effective and I rarely have a sprung trap with no mole.<br /><br />The out o sight scissor trap is the best one.<br /><br />People who are giving this bad reviews must not be setting it correctly, I had the same problems until I learned to set them right.<br /><br />Do a google or youtube search and learn how to set them right and you will catch them.<br /><br />1. Keep your grass short to help spot the tunnels.<br /><br />2. Pick a tunnel and set the trap correctly on that tunnel, stomp all of the other tunnels down flat, not the one your trapping on.<br /><br />3. If you haven't caught the mole in 48 hours, the tunnel is abandoned and needs to be relocated.  Stomp the tunnel down flat and move the trap to a different newer tunnel.<br /><br />I usually catch them overnight\n",

      "Our yard was COMPLETELY overrun with moles this year.  The lawn was dead and the trails were everywhere we walked--literally.  We tried sulphur bombs (the Giant Destroyer), spring traps, castor oil (lots of it), Talpirid (80 worms), sonic molechasers (13 of them on 3/4 acre--way more than was suggested), and finally a professional mole guy which cost us $450 to place poison bait (all we got from that is a sick cat and a $150 vet bill), but no dead moles.  Killing grubs doesn't work because their main love is earthworms and you definitely don't want to kill those.  Everything that you read says that trapping is the only way to truly rid yourself of moles.  They only reproduce once a year and usually have litters of 3 to 4 pups--and half of them die.  The only reason we get overrun by them is from not trapping them and using deterrents that only work for short periods of time, allowing their numbers to increase (from what I've read). I read about this product and all the great reviews and I chose to *believe* one last time, so I ordered 6 of them. We went outside this afternoon to set 2 of the traps and within 1 hour we had our first mole!!!  He was huge and very well fed, he lived a good life. RIP.<br /><br />Initially, we did get completely frustrated and we each threw one across the yard, then we calmed down and figured it out. The reviewers all had great tips and I re-read them.  The thing to remember is to set the trap and put the safety on BEFORE you try and put it in the ground (sounds obvious, but it seemed easier to place it in the ground first and it wasn't). The spring is VERY strong, but the metal bars they put in the package make it easy enough to open the trap with both hands, then hold it open with one hand, and keeping the plate near the ground for leverage, engage the pin on the striking plate and flip the locking pin over.  The only other hard part is finding the right type of tunnel!<br /><br />I'm convinced there is no \"natural* way to get rid of moles--I wish there was--but the only thing that is ultimately going to work is trapping them.  Be patient and don't give up, it really is easy to set this trap once you get the hang of it.  GOOD LUCK!<br /><br />UPDATE 11/2009:  Just caught another one this morning!  The trails are dwindling...<br /><br />UPDATE 5/2010:  Our grass finally grew back in after the moles killed every square inch of the lawn last year. We ended up getting about 5 moles. Just got the traps out again for the summer season as we noticed a small area being dug up.  We found a straight trail, set the trap and caught him within 4 hours!\n",

      "Freeze-dried liver treats are easy to carry around in a treat pouch, don't have to be refrigerated and, so far as I know, are healthy, high-protein snacks without a lot of chemical additives and preservatives. All of those attributes are nice but wouldn't be so important if the dog didn't like them. Our dog, who gets lots of small, bite-size treats as part of his continuing training, gets tired of diced sausage-shaped moist food from the pet store and cut-up franks from the grocery, but he'll run a mile for a liver treat! I do wish they were smaller and/or less expensive. We usually cut them in quarters with a sharp knife to make them last longer.\n",

      "Hallelujah!!!  The wicked mole is dead.<br /><br />For 2 years I have hunted this critter.  I have read the entire internet.  2 years of research led me here.<br /><br />For those of you with mole problems, let me save you some time.  Forget everything you think you know.  The only way to deal with moles is to kill them.  The only way to kill them is to trap them.  Baits don't work.  Treating for grubs don't work.  Moles primarily feed on worms, not grubs.  Sonic vibration thingys don't work.  These traps work.<br /><br />BUT...<br /><br />Don't follow the directions on the package.  I will do my best to explain how to employ this product.<br /><br />First of all, if you have to, stamp down all mole runs in your yard.  Ordinarily, you don't want to do this, because it just encourages the mole to dig new runs, thus doing more damage.  But you need a current picture of where the mole is active in your yard.<br /><br />The next day after you have stamped down all the runs, observe any new runs.  You are looking for long straight runs.  Long straight runs are like mole highways.  The curvy short runs are hunting roads.  The curvy runs are less traveled.  Hunt the highways.<br /><br />Open the trap and set the safety catch.  Set the trap down next to the run where you want to place it.  Take your foot, and stamp down the mole run just where you want to place the trap.  Should only be about your foot's width.  Don't push down hard.  You want the ground you stamp down to be level with the rest of the yard.<br /><br />Now take a straight blade shovel and create a notch on either side where the trap blades will go.  You don't have to go real deep.  Just a couple inches.  Wiggle the shovel if you have to, to create those \"pockets\" for the blades of the trap to go into.<br /><br />Carefully place the trap into the notches or pockets you just created until the trigger of the trap is level to the ground.<br /><br />Unhook the safety.<br /><br />It took me 3 days to catch my mole once I set my trap this way.  I moved it once after the first day because I wasn't happy about the run I had originally placed it. If you don't catch your mole after 3 days, then look for a better spot.<br /><br />Warning!!  If you go out to check your trap, bring a shovel and wear shoes.  When I got mine, he wasn't dead.  The trap had just got him in the back and he wasn't going anywhere, but he was alive.  So when you pull up your trap, go slow and be gentle.  You don't want to accidentally release him.  Be ready to whack him with the shovel.<br /><br />For 2 years this mole has terrorized my yard.  I was at my wits end.  My yard is destroyed.  Let the healing begin thanks to this product.  Now kill some moles!!<br /><br />EDIT 3-24-09: I just wanted to give everyone an update.  I got my third mole last night using these traps.  Add that to the 3 my parents have killed, our family alone is responsible for killing at least a basketball team of moles.  If anyone has any questions about how to kill moles, post or email me, and I am positive we can kill your mole too.<br /><br />EDIT 3-16-10:  I've been reading some other reviews here and I wanted to clear up some misconceptions and misunderstandings.<br /><br />First, if it looks like the moles are going around your trap, the most likely cause is that the trap is set too deep.  That ties to another reviewer who said they set the trap with the trigger at grass level.  That would be too shallow.  Before you set the trap, tamp down the run to GROUND level (not grass level).  When you cut the notches for the trap blades, and place the trap in the ground, the trigger should lay even with the rest of the ground.<br /><br />Second, while true that moles will eat grubs, their primary food source are worms.  Worms are usually more plentiful, and they move through the ground, thus making them easier to find for a hungry mole.  Grubs are more stationary.  A mole will eat them, but it requires more luck to find them.<br /><br />Third, if you don't get a mole in the first day, don't panic.  Give it a few days. Remember, the best place to put the traps are in the long straight runs. Those are the mole highways.  Just because it's a highway though, doesn't mean your mole will use that highway every day.  Give it some time.  It's not necessary to move your traps too often.  Even if your mole seems to be active in another area of your yard, if you picked a good spot to place your trap, he will come back and use his highway again.<br /><br />Fourth, moles are territorial.  There may be some overlap, but it's minimal.  HOWEVER, keep this in mind.  Just like you, moles prefer to travel along pre-dug roads.  You don't build a new road every time you want to go to the grocery store.  Moles don't like to either.  So, even if you kill your mole, it is VERY likely that another mole will move into your yard.  Keep in mind also, that the runs you see at ground level, are only a fraction of the amount of tunnels that might be running through your yard.  Moles don't hibernate.  They follow the worms in the winter, and worms dig in deeper during the winter.  For a mole to survive the winter, that mole has a whole labyrinth of tunnels deep under ground.  Easy pickings for another mole looking to move into your yard.<br /><br />EDIT 4-29-10:  Taught my boss how to use these traps and he got his first mole this weekend.  The moles in St. Louis are having a bad day!<br /><br />EDIT 5-28-10:  Got another one last night.  I've had a mole kicking around the area for the last few months and just couldn't get a good run to trap.  Finally, the idiot moved into another area of the yard, and to do that he had to make a couple long straight runs to get there.  Well,  that was his last mistake.  I had the traps in the ground less than 12 hours.  I woke up this morning to dead mole.  There really is nothing better with your Corn Flakes than dead mole.<br /><br />EDIT 7-22-10:  So about a week after I killed my last mole in May I got another one destroying my yard.  Took me 2 months, but that mole is now dead.  What a wonderful thing heavy rain is.  When it rains, it brings the worms up, and the moles are soon to follow.  Right into the waiting arms of the sharp teeth of my mole trap.<br /><br />EDIT 9-9-10:  Pics are up!  If anyone has any suggestions or questions about the pics, just leave a comment and I'll see what I can do.<br /><br />EDIT 9-10-10:  Less than 12 hours later, I'm the proud parent of a dead mole.  I kill more moles before 9am than most people do all day.<br /><br />EDIT 9-30-10:  Posted 3 pics that show how to prep the trap itself before setting it.  I also tried to label some components just so if there are questions in the future, we all have a reference for terminology.  I'm sure my verbage isn't right, but as long as we all understand the different parts, that's all that matters.<br /><br />EDIT 10-22-10:  There have been a number of commenters and reviewers that have asked about sandy/loose soil.  We haven't been able to give a very good answer because I don't have any experience in that kind of condition.  Another reviewer does though, and he did a really good job of explaining his technique.  The following is a link to his comments.  Thanks Bjay25.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />So it looks like Amazon won't hyper link in reviews, but just copy that link and paste it into another tab on your browser and that will take you right to Bjay25's comments.  That should be real helpful for people in the south that are dealing with sandy soil.<br /><br />EDIT 1-25-11:  Doesn't everyone hunt moles in the dead of winter?  I got my first winter mole last night.  I have all but moved in with my girlfriend, and after taking care of her yard last summer, we started noticing some mole activity.  Mostly in a flower bed, which is a tough place to trap.  I kept waiting for a good run to trap, but never got one.  Then winter came, and I kind of forgot about it.  I figured I'd get him next spring.  So then I was out taking down xmas lights, and the yard was TORE UP!  I tried stomping down runs, and was hoping I would get a highway to trap, but couldn't get a good one.  I finally got fed up, set a few traps and stomped down all the other runs.  About a week ago, it snowed pretty good here.  So the traps have been covered.  Yesterday was warmish, and the snow started to melt.  That allowed the traps to peek above the snow, and sure enough, the trap was sprung. I figured a kid prolly kicked it.  When I pulled it up, there he was.  In the middle of winter, on a day when we got freezing rain in the morning, I got a winter mole.  Remember, moles don't hibernate.  Usually they are deeper, to avoid the cold during the winter, but this one must have been desperate.  Maybe he thought he was safe since there was snow on the ground.  Wrongo buddy!<br /><br />EDIT 6-9-11:  This year is the hatch of the 13 year cicadas in St. Louis.  What does that have to do with moles?  Well, the cicada larvae emerge from the ground to mutate and mate.  What are they while they are in the ground and preparing to emerge?  They are mole food is what they are.
